# TTT Project Notes

## Introduction

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Zen.  After signing up and signing on the player must first start a new game in order to play.  A reset will set the stage for a new game to be created under the same User ID.

GAME URL: https://rickdean.github.io/wdi-ttt-project/

## User's Persepective

From User's perspective I created set of User Stories that helped in some of the decisions made during development.
- A User must know when they need to sign-up and sign-in.
- A User must know when a game needs to be created in order to play.
- A User must be presented with an aesthetically pleasing board.
- A User must be presented with a message that the game is over and who won.
- A User must have the ability to create a new game.

## The Layout

I utlized bootstrap for the framework of the User experience.  All styling was created with the sole purpose of keeping the
game board clean and enhancing the User's experience.

## Code Separation & Version Control

I went with a modular approach and utilized the template structure that was provided.  This allowed me to keep the HTML, SCSS, and Javascript code separate and compartmentalized.

Frequent commits to GitHub from my 'dev' branch ensured that I always had a clean copy of working code available to me should
I need to revert back to a previous state.

## Development History

The first step in planning the game to create a simple wireframe of the site and gameboard placement.

 - Logic Note (http://evolutiontalk.com/images/logic_notes.jpeg)

This was followed with the logic, in plain english, of the steps that would need to be involved to determine a winner.  From there it was a matter of using what I'd learned in class, Google searches, instructor, and classmate assistance to overcome obstacles along the way.  Challenges I faced were around the game api interface and this proved to be the focus of my efforts near the ened of the project.
